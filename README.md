This is a simple CMS & Blog system built with django. It supports pages and posts.

Somewhat special is that every page or post can have an unlimited number of attached files wich can be used to create galleries or slideshows.

It relies on multiple 3rd party libraries.

UndefCMS is available under the MIT license and was designed and developed by Philip Whitfield (www.undef.ch).

Please see INSTALL.md for install instructions.
